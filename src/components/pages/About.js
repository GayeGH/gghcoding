          Welcome to "GGH Coding"! My name is Gaye Haslam. I live in Greensboro,
          North Carolina and I recently completed UNC's Full Stack Web
          Development Bootcamp. My experience includes many years of teaching in
          the Elementary public school setting as well as the Adaptive Curriculum classroom.
          During the pandemic, I discovered that I really enjoyed working with
          different computer applications to teach, solve problems, and help
          parents with computer issues they were experiencing.
